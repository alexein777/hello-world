tradition is tradition


I am Aleksandar MladenoviÄ‡, student of Faculty of Mathematics, Belgrade University. I'm interested in programming, especially game-development and graphic design. I have solid experience in different programming languages, such as C, C++ and Java. I plan to work hardly on C# in the future. I'm interested in participating in different projects, in order to learn more and help others in the progress.
